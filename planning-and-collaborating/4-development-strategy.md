## 3. Development Strategy (_First Draft_)

> [example development strategy](./example-all-about-trees/planning/development-strategy.md)

In the _Development Strategy_ step of your project you will begin translating your _Must Have User Stories_ into specific coding tasks. This step is not simple, and it will take experience before it comes easily.

- difference between user story (milestone) and issues - a user one "simple" thing on the screen - issues: all the little things behind the scenes to make it happen

> Your development strategy will change as you write the project and learn more about it. This is a good thing!

- only include must-haves in the first draft of your strategy. you can add should and could haves as issues after all the must-haves are done (this is the Agile way, it will take some getting used to. that's why you learn it early)

Now that you all understand what you will build, it's time to set up the group's project repository. Get together with your team and discuss the wireframe, how will you break your website into steps and tasks? When you are done with this planning session your group repository should have a complete Development Strategy with large steps and smaller tasks.

You can take a look through the [./development-strategy](./development-strategy) folder of this repository to see some examples.
