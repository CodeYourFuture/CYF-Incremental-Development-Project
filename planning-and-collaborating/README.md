# Planning and Collaborating

The main focus of this module is planning and collaborating on software projects. You've already seen all the pieces you need in the Precourse! To collaborate on a group project you will need:

- A repository
- Planning Documents
- Issues
- labels, milestones and assignees
- A Project Board
- Pull Requests + code review

Wait, what?! HTML, CSS and JavaScript aren't even on that list! Understanding why they are not on the list will give you a head start towards becoming a great developer.

The difference between an ok developer and a great developer doesn't have to do with the languages, frameworks or technologies they use. It has to do with their discipline in planning, communication, and collaboration. Your projects in this module may only use HTML and CSS, but the workflows you learn will be useful all the way into your first job:

2. [Project Definition](./2-project-definition.md)
