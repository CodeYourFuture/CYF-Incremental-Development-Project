## Development Strategy

You will now translate your _**must-have** User Stories_ into specific coding tasks, you can plan the rest of your user stories during Development after the **must-have**s are built.

As you build your project you will find mistakes in your strategy. Don't panic; adapt. This is the _agile_ way! It's not possible to plan everything perfectly.

When you need to change your plan during development you can update your project board, but _do not_ change your Development Strategy. You want to keep your original strategy document so that during the retrospective you can compare what you _actually did_ to what you _planned to do_.

Take a look through the [example development strategy](./example-all-about-trees/planning/development-strategy.md) to see how you can structure your files. The example also includes extra comments (_label_ and _issue_) to help you understand the file can be translated into a project board.
