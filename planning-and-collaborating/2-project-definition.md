# 2. Project Definition

The first step to developing a software project is to make sure everyone in your team agrees on what you will be building. It's easy to get in trouble later on if you planned a larger project than you are capable of delivering, or if your team mates understand the project differently from on another.

This is the time for brainstorming, crazy ideas, silly questions and open discussion of the project. All ideas are welcome! You should be less concerned about finding the _right_ answer, and more concerned about finding a _shared_ answer.

By the end of this step your group's repository should have:

## A README

Write a README for your project. It does not need to be perfect yet but should give anyone arriving at your repository a clear idea of what is going on. You can always open issues later on to update the README during Development.

## A Repository Description

Set your [repository description](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7757751/how-do-you-change-a-repository-description-on-github) so that people can get an idea what your project is about directly from you GitHub profile or from the web.

## Constraints

Often the most helpful thing you can can do to define your project is to be clear about _what it isn't_. Thinking big is great for brainstorming but can get in the way of finishing your projects on time.

An important step to _scoping_ your project is to discuss your group's **constraints** before you even begin thinking of user stories. Defining your constraints will help to define a realistic project and commit to it. Constraints can also help you to build a more creative project!

It may not sound intuitive, but the fewer restrictions you have on your work the less likely you are to find a creative solution. One of the crucial skills you need to learn is how to place _constructive_ constraints on your project and on your team.
