# Project Board

If your team did a good job writing your Development Strategy, setting up your Project Board should be easy - pretty much copy-pasting.

## Labels

Create one **_label_** for each type of task in your strategy. In this module you will want these labels to start with:

- `type: documentation`: any tasks that involve writing _about_ your project. ie. updating the README
- `type: html`: any task that involves writing HTML
- `type: css`: any task that involves writing CSS

You can always create new labels during Development if your team agrees it's necessary.

## Issues

Create one **_issue_** for each task in your Development Strategy. A task in your Dev Strategy is a single bullet point. Be sure each issue has:

- _labels_ to tell what types of work are included in this task
- a _milestone_ to say what user story this task is a part of (**planning**, **development**, **retrospective**)
- (optional) a checklist to know what is required in this task

## Columns

Finally, create your project board and add 4 columns:

1. **Todo**: Claimed and unclaimed issues that no one is actively working on.
2. **Doing** Tasks someone is actively working on. Use the `help-wanted` label in this column if you are blocked.
3. **Ready for Review**: Issues with a linked PR to review. If changes are requested you can move the issue back to _Todo_ or _Doing_.
4. **Done**: Issues that have been closed for any reason including: the linked PR was merged, the discussion has finished, or the task is no longer necessary.

When your columns are ready, move all of your issues into the **_Todo_** column and you're ready to go!
