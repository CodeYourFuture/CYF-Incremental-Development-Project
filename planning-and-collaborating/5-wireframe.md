## Wireframe

> [example wireframe](./example-all-about-trees/planning/wireframe.md)

A wireframe is a simplified drawing of what your website will look like. Wireframes don't have any real text, images, or design. The idea is just to lay out the basic skeleton of your site and to make sure that your group agrees on what to build.

Use your Backlog as a guide when designing your wireframe. Make sure that your **must-have** user stories are in the wireframe. You can also include your **should haves** into the wireframe, but **could-have**s aren't necessary. Take a look at this [fabulous wireframe](https://github.com/OksanaShulha/HYF.be-5/blob/main/planning/hyf-wireframe.png) from Class 13-14. Imagine how helpful it would be to have one of these for your group project!

Here's two websites you can try to create and share wireframes: [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/), [wireframe.cc](http://wireframe.cc/)
