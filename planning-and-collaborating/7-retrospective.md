# 7. Retrospective

> “Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.”

All done :)

Your team has either finished the project ahead of time, or the deadline has arrived and you're still not finished. No problem either way!

A retrospective is meant for looking back at how the project went and learning what to do differently next time. An incomplete project with a great retrospective is still a success.

## Strategy vs. Board

Take some time as a group to compare your Development Strategy to your Project Board.

- What parts of your plan went as expected?
- What parts of your plan did not work out?
- Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?
- Or remove extra steps?

## The Four Points

Your group will summarize your work by providing answers to these three questions. You can have more than one answer! You can answer with bullet points, paragraphs, links, images ... whatever is most clear.

- **Stop Doing**: be specific!
- **Continue Doing**: what mistakes did you make? did you miss a step? could your communication have been better? be specific!
- **Start Doing Doing**
- **Lessons Learned**: what advice would you give yourselves in the next project? This might be to do something again that went well, to avoid a mistake you made this time, or some crazy new idea to try out.
