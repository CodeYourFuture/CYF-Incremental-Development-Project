      <br />
      <p>
        In this example, the tasks have been assigned in the development
        strategy.
        <br />
        This is not required!
        <br />
        You can also plan all of your tasks and create all of your issues
        without assigning anyone.
        <br />
        In the Development step of your project, each group member can assign
        themselves an issue when they are ready to develop it.
