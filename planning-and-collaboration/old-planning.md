## User Story Dependencies

> How to plan your development schedule.

Some user stories depend on each other, some do not. Figuring out these relationships will make it possible go from a disorganized backlog to an organized development strategy.

Understanding these dependencies can also allow you to develop much more efficiently. You can develope user stories that do not depend on each other in parallel instead of waiting for one to finish before moving on the next.

Here are some questions you can ask yourself to help understand your project:

- Do I need _A_ in order to be able to build _B_?
- Can the user do B without A being available?

A nice way to visualize these relationships is by creating a graph to visually represent dependencies:

[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) is a great tool for collaboratively writing these diagrams.

## Defining Tasks

> How to break the story into coding tasks.

Answering these questions is a way to break down complex user stories and to determine what code is needed. Following this questions guide will help you fill in the specifications of each step in your `development-strategy.md`

Handlers are the glue of your user stories. Understanding your answers to these questions will not only help you decide which tasks to develop, but can be used to plan the details of the user story's handler:

1. **User Story Objectives**
   1. _... ?_
2. **User Flow ?**
   1. _... ?_
3. **Wireframes ?**
   1. _... ?_

## Project Board

> How to manage your team's project

Convert your development strategy into:

- milestones (user stories or steps in your dev-strat). You can include the _acceptance criteria_ as a checklist in the milestone's description
- issues (.js files or small fixes)
- labels (one per concern, plus bugs, help, ...)
- a project board for all the issues

This isn't a permanent thing! You can always adjust the project board, issues and development strategy as the project evolves; adding issues, removing issues, adjusting tasks ... whatever is necessary to make the project go smoothly.

## Sprinting and Reviewing

The fun part, writing code and closing issues ;)
