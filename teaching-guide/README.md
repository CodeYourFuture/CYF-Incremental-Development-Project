# Teaching Guide

> A little guide for who ever is teaching this module, and for curious students.

This Incremental Development module is a module about how to break down and plan projects, first alone and then as a team. Students will be learning about responsive design and accessibility but that happens as self-study. Class time will be spent talking about project planning and Collaborating.

The two main focuses of this module should be:

- writing and interpreting development strategy files
- using issues, labels, PRs and project boards to carry out the development strategy

When you give feedback on projects you should focus more on the students' strategy and process than on the finished code.

## Before this Module

In the previous module ([precourse](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/precourse/)) students set up all the softwares they should need for this module and learned how to:

- write and lint markdown using VSCode extensions
- develop an HTML/CSS project locally with LiveServer
- commit, push & pull changes between local and github
- a first taste of issues and project boards when they submitted their precourse assignments

## During this Module

Projects in this module will be basic HTML/CSS websites so students can focus on the development process. The first two projects don't even ask students to write their own code from scratch, they will be reverse-engineering the finished code from tutorials. This helps to put the focus on planning and collaborating since the code is not a challenge.

### Common Confusions

Students will have confusions about HTML/CSS but those are not the biggest priority in this module. In an ideal world there would be time to cover everything but as things are you will want to focus students' attention to organized development and project management workflows. That said, here are some common confusions about Git, GitHub, incremental development, and collaboration:

- The difference between Git and GitHub
- The difference between a step in the development strategy and a task within a step
- Branches: pushing to them, and sending PRs
- > there's always something missing on this list! Send us a PR if you know what it is

### Week 1

This week is about project planning and GitHub project management (issues, PRs & labels/milestones). This will feel quite abstract and confusing for students at first. But we've found that with the limited time available it's better to start with the big picture and rehearse it for 3 weeks than to build up from a simpler workflow.

Remind students that the workflows they're encountering this week are the same workflows they will use for all projects at HYF and are a good prep for professional collaboration. They don't need to master this in the 3 weeks of this module, just get the big idea. The details can fill in with time

#### In Class

This is the students' first day of class and their first time meeting coaches. Take all the time you need at the beginning of class for each coach to introduce themselves, tell a little about what you do as a developer, and answer questions from students.

After introductions the rest of the time before break should be spent presenting the [planning-and-collaborating](../planning-and-collaborating/) folder, reading through the steps and showing the `example-all-about-trees` folder.

Break.

The second half of class should be spent in small groups preparing for the week's project. If everything goes well each group should leave class having completed steps 1 & 2 of Planning and Collaborating for their loruki-website project (create a group repository and write a README). Kudos for any group that can make it to step 3 (starting a backlog).

A good way to run class might be to spend some time as a full class reading through the finished source code in [loruki-website](../loruki-website) and discussing how you might break it into parts, and which parts you might create first. After this full-class presentation the students can break into small groups to get started.

#### Homework Project

This week's project is a group project, students will reverse-engineer the code from the [loruki-website tutorial](https://github.com/bradtraversy/loruki-website) by Brad Traversy. Each group will need to follow the steps of [planning-and-collaborating](../planning-and-collaborating) to rebuild as much of the project as they have time for.

When reviewing projects you will be looking more at the quality of their branches, planning and project management than at their live demo. The focus is on the planning and Collaborating workflows, it is better for a group to work well together and only finish a few tasks than that they rush through tasks in a disorganized way. The project checklist in the _Week 1_ section of this module repo will help you know what to look out for.

### Week 2

Nothing new this week, a continuation of last week. Class time will be spent taking questions from last week and presenting each group's Retrospective.

#### In Class

The first thing to cover in class will be any questions students have from last week. You should ask students to post their questions as `question` issues in the class repo. If there are no questions then you can go on to ...

Each group should present their Retrospective from last week's project. Ask each group to keep their presentations to under 5 minutes to leave time for discussion before break, and so they get used to giving concise status reports.

Break.

The goal of your time after break should be to make sure each group is ready to start the week's project (reverse-engineering https://hackyourfuture.be). After looking through the website as a full class and discussing how you might break it into steps, you can break into small groups. What you focus on in each group will depend on what they struggled with last week. Here are some ideas:

- git & CLI workflows
- creating a wire-frame from hackyourfuture.be
- writing a backlog based on the website
- setting up the repository
- discussing issue tracking and code review

#### Homework Project

This week is the beginning of a 2-week group project, the goal is to reverse-engineer as much of hackyourfuture.be as possible. Students will need to begin a repository from scratch following the steps from Planning and Collaborating.

### Week 3

Like last week, this week will be spent reviewing the project and preparing for the coming week.

#### In Class

The first thing to cover in class will be any questions students have from last week. You should ask students to post their questions as `question` issues in the class repo. If there are no questions then you can go on to ...

Each group should present a short report on their progress over the last week, a good format for this is the 3 points of a Retrospective: what went well, what went less well, lessons learned. Ask each group to keep their presentations to under 5 minutes to leave time for discussion before break, and so they get used to giving concise status reports.

Break.

The goal of your time after break should be to make sure each group is on track in their project. If there were any common troubles you can cover them as a full class before breaking out into small groups. What you focus on in each group will depend on what they struggled with last week. Here are some ideas:

- tidying up the project board
- code review practice
- scoping and priorities with only a week left

#### Homework Project

Finish as much as possible from hackyourfuture.be and write up a solid retrospective.

## After this Module

In the next module ([ux-ui-design](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/ux-ui-design), 2 weeks) students will learn about design thinking, focusing on the user, and designing user journies.

The project will be to design and build a personal home pages, one for themselves and one for a classmate.
